## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

# Extra!

You can also put in **inline commands** such as this one where we calcu;ate the average speed using `mean(cars$speed, na.rm=T)` 

Average speed is calculated as `r mean(cars$speed, na.rm=T)` in this dataset.

Cars dataframe *as-is*
```{r cars_asis, results='asis'}
cars
# Extra!
```

Cars dataframe as **markup**
```{r cars_mrkp, results='markup'}
cars
```


Cars dataframe with `kable()`
```{r cars_kbl}
knitr::kable(mtcars, digits = 2)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Additional info

This additional info is entered as a pipe-table. It does not live in a dataframe and is really not worth to put into one. 

| Plant | Temp. | Growth |
|:------|:-----:|-------:|
| A     | 20    | 0.65   |
| B     | 20    | 0.95   |
| C     | 20    | 0.15   |


*Simple!*

I may want to get a list of some files in my working directory.

#```{Bash}
#ls –lh
#```

## Python
```{Python python.reticulate = FALSE}
x = 'hello, python world!‘
print(x.split(' '))
```
